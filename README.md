# dokku-supervisord

dokku-supervisord is a plugin for [dokku][dokku] that injects
[supervisord][super] to run applications. It will convert a normal Procfile to
supervisord.conf format when starting the application.

Normally, dokku only runs the `web` process within Procfile. The
dokku-supervisord plugin will run all process types (web, worker, etc.) and
will restart crashed applications.

## Installation

```sh
dokku plugin:install https://github.com/jwigley/dokku-supervisord.git
```

All future deployments will use supervisord to start all processes.

## v0.4.0 breaking change

v0.4.0 renamed the `post-release` to `post-build-buildstep` to keep compatibility with upstream dokku. If you're using an older version of dokku, be sure to pin your version to v0.3.x.

## Docker 0.10 support

dokku-supervisord v0.3.0 changed the expected namespace from "app" to "dokku"
to support Docker 0.10. See details within the [dokku issue][docker10]. If
you're using a dokku version from before [this commit][docker10commit], stick
with v0.2.x of dokku-supervisord.
